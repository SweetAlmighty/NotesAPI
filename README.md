# NotesAPI
Technical assessment: Build an API that allows for the retrieval, addition, and removal of notes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] You should be able to get a list of all notes.
- [x] You should be able to get a specific note.
- [x] You should be able to add a note.
- [x] You should be able to edit a note.
- [x] You should be able to delete a note.
- [ ] The notes should be persisted.

## Running the application

After cloning the repo, open the solution in Visual Studio.

Once inside Visual Studio, make sure your Debug menu is set to IIS Express, and that you have a web browser selected.

Click play to run the API. The API should now be running a local port (ie https://localhost:44314/)

## Using the application

The repo contains a local html page that allows you to interact with the API.

Through the relatively simple UI, you can add, edit, and delete multiple notes, as shown below.
